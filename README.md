# space-invaders-turtle

Welcome to the space invaders game, a classic from Atari. Just this time made in Python. 
Runs on the turtle module.

Issues:
1. For now the inveders fire at random. I would like for them to shoot near the player, but have not implemented this yet.
2. There is no start screen, and the win and game over screens are static, and you cannot restart the game.

Potential improvements:
1. Would like to work on the shooting AI a bit more. So that the aliens spray their bullets better.
2. Want to implement a function that when the aliens reach a certain threshhold, you would lose.
3. Want to have levels, once all invaders are dead, it would increase their moving speed. At some points their firing as well.
4. Would like to implement a boss actually. By friend suggested it and I think it would be a cool idea.
5. Would like to work on the bullets a bit more as well, they are very blocky now.
6. Lastly I think the project is quite complicated, I am sure I can optimise.

Otherwise, enjoy!
